# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT GUIDELINES üö®

## ‚õî NEVER DEPLOY THIS PROJECT TO PRODUCTION SITES

This is a development/dashboard project that should **NEVER** be deployed to production website domains.

---

## üéØ CORRECT PROJECT MAPPINGS

### Production Websites (DO NOT DEPLOY DASHBOARDS HERE):
- **siteoptz.ai** ‚Üí Main SiteOptz website (Next.js)
- **siteoptz.com** ‚Üí Agency website (Next.js)
- **cubansoultx.com** ‚Üí Cuban Soul TX website
- **restorationsenterprisetx.com** ‚Üí Restorations Enterprise website
- **cummingsmiledentistry.com** ‚Üí Cumming Smile Dentistry website

### Dashboard/Development Projects (SAFE TO DEPLOY):
- **siteoptz-scraping** ‚Üí This React dashboard project
- **optz-bi** ‚Üí Business Intelligence dashboard
- **siteoptz-v5** ‚Üí Development version

---

## ‚úÖ PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### BEFORE ANY DEPLOYMENT, YOU MUST:

1. **VERIFY PROJECT NAME**
   ```bash
   # Check current linked project
   cat .vercel/project.json
   
   # Expected output for this project:
   # {"projectId":"...", "orgId":"...", "settings":{"framework":"create-react-app"}}
   ```

2. **CONFIRM PROJECT TYPE**
   - Is this a dashboard/admin panel? ‚úÖ Safe to deploy to development projects
   - Is this a public website? ‚õî DO NOT deploy to production domains

3. **CHECK DEPLOYMENT TARGET**
   ```bash
   # List current project deployments
   vercel ls
   
   # VERIFY the project name matches expected target
   ```

4. **USE PREVIEW DEPLOYMENTS FIRST**
   ```bash
   # Always deploy to preview first
   vercel
   
   # Only deploy to production after verification
   vercel --prod
   ```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY RULES

### RULE 1: Project Isolation
- **NEVER** link dashboard projects to production website projects
- **ALWAYS** maintain separate Vercel projects for:
  - Production websites
  - Development dashboards
  - Testing environments

### RULE 2: Explicit Project Linking
```bash
# WRONG - Don't use generic commands
vercel --prod

# RIGHT - Always specify project explicitly
vercel link --project siteoptz-scraping --yes
vercel --prod
```

### RULE 3: Rollback Procedure
If you accidentally deploy to the wrong project:
```bash
# 1. List recent deployments
vercel ls --prod

# 2. Find the last working deployment
# Look for the last "Ready" deployment before your mistake

# 3. Rollback immediately
vercel rollback [deployment-url] --yes
```
