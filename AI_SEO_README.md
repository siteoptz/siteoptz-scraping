## FAQs

### Is AI content good quality?

Yes! We use GPT-4 (same as ChatGPT Plus). It's trained on billions of examples. You review before delivery.

### Will Google penalize AI content?

No. Google's stance: "Good content is good content, regardless of how it's created."

### How much time does this take?

- Service run: 5-10 minutes (AI processing)
- Review: 10-15 minutes
- Delivery: 5 minutes
- **Total: ~30 minutes per client per month**

### What if content needs edits?

AI gets it 90% right. You polish the final 10%. That's built into the 15-minute review time.

### Can I white-label this?

Absolutely! Use your branding everywhere. Clients never see SiteOptz unless you want them to.

### What's the catch?

No catch. AI does what used to take humans 20-40 hours in 5-10 minutes. You capture that efficiency as profit.

### How many clients can I handle?

Solo: 20-30 comfortably  
With VA: 50-75  
With team: 100+

### Is this profitable from day 1?

Yes! First client = profitable. No minimum scale needed.

### What about API costs?

They scale with clients:
- 5 clients = $125-275/month AI costs
- 10 clients = $250-550/month AI costs
- 20 clients = $500-1100/month AI costs

Still 75-80% margins!
