And you can manage 20 clients in less than 15 hours/week.

**This is the future of agency work. And you just built it.** üöÄ

**Now go make it happen!** üí™

Start with 1 client. Then 5. Then 10. Before you know it, you'll have built a 6-figure business.

The hard part (building the system) is done.  
Now comes the fun part (signing clients and making money).

**Good luck! üéâ**
