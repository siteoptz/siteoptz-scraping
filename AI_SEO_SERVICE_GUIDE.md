## üéØ Sales Strategy

   - Need local SEO but can't afford $5K/month agencies
   - Perfect for $800-1200/month packages

2. **E-commerce Stores**
   - Need content marketing but short on time
   - Will pay $1000-1500/month for consistent content

3. **Startups & SaaS Companies**
   - Need SEO but can't hire full-time
   - Will pay $1200-2000/month for complete service

### Sales Pitch Template

```
"Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] could benefit from stronger SEO. 

Most agencies charge $3,000-5,000/month for what we offer at $1,000/month.

Here's what you get:
‚úÖ 15 SEO-optimized blog posts monthly
‚úÖ Complete technical SEO audit
‚úÖ Ongoing competitor tracking
‚úÖ Link building campaign
‚úÖ Monthly strategy & reports

This is the same work that would cost you:
- $2,250 for content alone (15 articles @ $150)
- $800 for technical audit
- $400 for competitor analysis
- $800 for link building
= $4,250 total value

Your investment: Just $1,000/month

Interested in a quick demo?"
```

### Objection Handlers

**"That seems too cheap to be good quality"**
- "We use the same AI technology that major agencies pay $10K+/month for (GPT-4, Claude). We've just automated 90% of the process, passing savings to you."

**"We already have a content writer"**
- "Great! They can focus on strategy and editing while AI handles first drafts. That's 20 hours/week back for your team."

**"Will Google penalize AI content?"**
- "Google's guidelines are clear: good content is good content, regardless of how it's created. Our AI content is fact-checked, well-researched, and optimized. Plus, your team reviews everything before publishing."

**"We tried cheap SEO before and it didn't work"**
- "Those were likely low-quality outsourced services. We use GPT-4 (same AI ChatGPT uses), trained on billions of high-quality examples. Plus, you get full transparency - review everything before it goes live."
