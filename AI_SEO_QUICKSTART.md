## Tips for Success

### 1. **Start Small**
Begin with 3-5 test clients, perfect your process, then scale.

### 2. **Review AI Output**
Spend 10-15 minutes reviewing content before sending to clients. AI is 90% there, you add the 10% polish.

### 3. **Set Expectations**
Tell clients they'll receive deliverables within 48 hours of service run. This gives you time to review.

### 4. **Target Local Businesses**
Plumbers, dentists, lawyers, contractors - they need SEO but can't afford $5K/month agencies.

### 5. **Show Value**
Explain to clients: "These 15 articles would cost $2,250 alone ($150 each). You're getting that PLUS technical audit, competitor analysis, and link building for just $1,000."
